## Overview

In this programming homework, I implemented solutions for two distinct problems using graph data structures. Problem 1 involves creating a directed graph and finding two-step paths from a given starting point. Problem 2 requires reading graph data from a text file, identifying non-connected neurons, and printing relevant graph information.

## Problem Statements

- **Problem 1**: Finding Two-Step Paths
  - Implemented a directed graph data structure and algorithms to find two-step paths from a given starting vertex.
  
- **Problem 2**: Identifying Non-Connected Neurons
  - Developed a program to read graph data from a text file, identify non-connected neurons, and print graph information.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:


- **CMPE-224-HW2/**: Root directory for the homework assignment.
  - **Question 1/**: Directory for Problem 1.
    - **src/**: Contains the Java source files for Problem 1.
  - **Question 2/**: Directory for Problem 2.
    - **src/**: Contains the Java source files for Problem 2.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for the problem you want to work on (`Question 1` for Problem 1, `Question 2` for Problem 2).
3. Compile the Java source files.
4. **Ensure that the input text files (`HW2_Q1_text.txt` for Problem 1, `HW2_Q2_text.txt` for Problem 2) are in the appropriate directory before running the code.**
5. Run the main program to execute the solution.

## Testing

Specific test cases were used to validate the functionality of the programs. Details of the testing process and outcomes can be found in the [report](Report.pdf).
